## Project Details

### 1. Project Overview
#### 1.1 Reasons for Choosing Option B
Option B, "Predicting the Final RSR," was selected for its complexity and strategic value. It allows a deeper analysis of long-term performance trends which are crucial for making informed decisions in training and breeding.

#### 1.2 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 2735 entries and 18 columns including race details, horse profiles, and past performance metrics.

#### 1.3 Methodology
The project utilizes various machine learning models to predict the RSR. The performance of these models is measured using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### 2. Data Exploration
Detailed analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand the distributions and relationships of various features.

### 3. Data Preparation
Includes cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, handling outliers, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

### 4. Model Development
Multiple models including Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting have been trained and tuned to find the best predictor for RSR.

### 5. Results and Analysis
Comparative analysis of all models based on RMSE and MSE, providing insights suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 6. Conclusion
Final thoughts on model performances, with a special note on the superiority of the Random Forest model in this context. Recommendations for future work include enhancing feature engineering and exploring more advanced models.
